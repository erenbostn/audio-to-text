# Changelog

This file records **notable, user-visible changes only**.
It is not a full history of commits or refactors.

Non-notable changes (internal refactors, formatting, code cleanup)
must NOT be added here.

## What qualifies as a Notable Change?

- User-visible behavior or UX flow
- URL structure, routing, or SEO behavior
- Security, privacy, rate limiting, or spam protection
- Performance with observable user impact
- Build, deployment, or runtime requirements (env vars, build steps)

Pure refactors with no behavior change are NOT notable.
