# Interfaces & Contracts

This document defines **external behavior contracts**.
These contracts are binding and must not be changed implicitly.

If a task requires changing any contract:

- The change must be documented here FIRST (append-only)
- The impact must be explicitly stated
- Backward compatibility must be considered
